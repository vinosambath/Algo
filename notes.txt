Kruskal
Take the minimum weight edge, if it doesn't form a cycle, attach it to the graph.

Djikstra
Take the minimum cost vertex from source and find the shortest path to the adjacent vertices.

Prims
Take the minium cost vertex in the tree and add it to the graph.

Ford Forgusen
Max Flow
Find an augumented path from source S to sink (Target) T. Find the minimum weight edge.
Decrement weight in the path by minimum weight (residual weight of edge).
Continue until there is a path

Min Cut
After residual edges are updated, do a dfs, edge which is not reachable from source and neighbour is reachable from source, is in min cut
